	abstract = {One of the most critical challenges is bird dropping deposition (soiling) on a glass surface of the photovoltaic (PV) module in an open environment of Western Rajasthan. This paper has been now exclusively emphasized to focus on effects of the bird dropping phenomenon on the performance of PV systems. The presented study includes the impact of the seasonal bird dropping effect on the reduction in energy yield with various tilt angle configurations. Considering this, the highest level of reduction in power loss was observed at the end of winter (March) and minimum during rainfall (August) every year. The sitting/walking tendency of birds with the plate inclination directly affects the PV output, which is demonstrated by optical study of glass samples (bird dropping patterns). Consequently, the studies of optical transmittance conclude the effect of dropping with different tilt regions I (β {\textless} 25°), II (25° ≤ β ≤ 60°), and III (60° ≤ β ≤ 90°), i.e., explained by bird movement onto the module surface. The result also showed that optimal inclination β (40°) has a smaller soiling effect in tilt region II (25–60°) correspondingly.},

More recently, snail trails have also been correlated with cell microcracks in PV modules. Despite a serious concern about effects of this phenomenon on PV module performances, very few publications have dealt with this subject. The main purpose of this study is to compare the performances of polycrystalline silicon PV modules affected by the snail trail phenomenon with the reference module. The comparison was performed focusing on I–V and P–V characteristics, thermography analysis, and energy production. Measurements were carried out at the SolarTech Lab of Politecnico di Milano, Italy. The obtained results show that the snail trails may affect the polycrystalline silicon PV modules performances: Compared with reference PV, the maximum power production at standard conditions is reduced by about 40\%. The energy production measured over 30 days was about 25\% lower than expected.},

	abstract = {In the past, the phenomenon of dust deposition on the glass cover of photovoltaic modules has been studied mainly in the Middle East, but little is known about the phenomenon in Central Europe. This paper focuses on the magnitude of the problem in Belgium (Köppen climate classification: Cfb). A variety of measurements were performed to determine the effect of dust settlement on the power output of photovoltaic modules. The physical properties of the collected dust were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A potential solution for the phenomenon, namely the usage of special coatings on the cover glass, was investigated. The results show that the problem of dust settlement on photovoltaic modules in Belgium is not as severe as in the Middle East. Nonetheless the problem exists and results in a constant power loss between 3\% and 4\% for the optimal tilt angle in Belgium which is 35° and with periods of regular rainfall. Please note that these results do not reflect a one year energy loss, further experiments are needed. Rain seems to have little cleaning effect on smaller dust particles (2–10μm), but on bigger particles (pollen, approx. 60μm) the cleaning effect is clearly visible. The use of special coatings on the glass have a potential reduction in power loss caused by dust settlement. However, at this moment, the extra cost associated with these coatings is not justified for photovoltaic modules in Belgium. Cleaning panels should only be done when soft tap water or demineralized water is available.},

	abstract = {Small solar home systems (SHS) have emerged as potential alternatives to grid electrifications, enabling households to make modest investments into their power systems, and to modify those systems according to their changing economic circumstances and power demands. Study shows that introduction to basic electricity access temporally stimulates increasing power demands in rural households, leading to eventual installations of larger systems that can power more electric appliances. Specifically, study shows that once households get access to basic electricity, they get to realise the socio-economic benefits of it and start to desire more appliances, with TV being the most desired appliance, followed by stereo systems, small fridges, and small cooling fans. These desires are realised temporally with increasing household incomes, leading to increasing loads, and thus to the modifications of the originally installed small SHS, to meet those increasing load demands; the desire for luxurious appliances leads to activities that contribute to increased household incomes, and thus to the modifications of the initial SHS. Acquisitions of luxury appliances lead to improvements in quality of life and to improved esteem visibility and social status within the local communities. Potentially, increasing load demands within a given community could lead to extensions of the national utility grid to those areas, as total loads justify such investments. SHS therefore potentially act as grid electrification stimulators, leading to eventual grid electrification of a given community.},

This review provides an overview of the microbial safety characteristics of milk production and fermented dairy products in Africa. The object is to highlight the main microbial food safety hazards in the dairy chain and to propose appropriate preventive and control measures. Pathogens of public health concern including Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella abortus and Coxiella burnettii, which have largely been eradicated in many developed nations, still persist in the dairy chain in Africa. Factors such as the natural antimicrobial systems in milk and traditional processing technologies, including fermentation, heating and use of antimicrobial additives, that can potentially contribute to microbial safety of milk and dairy products in Africa will be discussed. Practical approaches to controlling safety hazards in the dairy chain in Africa have been proposed. Governmental regulatory bodies need to set the necessary national and regional safety standards, perform inspections and put measures in place to ensure that the standards are met, including strong enforcement programs within smallholder dairy chains. Dairy chain actors would require upgraded knowledge and training in preventive approaches such as good agricultural practices (GAP), hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) design and implementation and good hygienic practices (GHPs). Food safety education programs should be incorporated into school curricula, beginning at the basic school levels, to improve food safety cognition among students and promote life-long safe food handling behaviour.},

	abstract = {In rural and undeveloped areas where there is no power grid and more water is needed for agriculture purposes and human uses, the choices for driving water pumps are usually solar via photovoltaic or a fuel driven engine, usually diesel. There are very distinct differences between the two power sources in terms of cost and reliability. The present paper presents an economic analysis of diesel and PV water pumping systems for irrigation purposes at Cairo, Egypt (Lat. 30° 2' 38" North, Long. 31° 14' 9" East). According to the location parameters, the required water demand, unit cost of different components and fuel cost, the study uses the HOMOR software and theoretical equations governing the photovoltaic operation to get the optimal system design and the related economic analysis. The study considered three systems for water pumping; PV only, hybrid PV-Diesel and Diesel only. The study showed the advantages of use photovoltaic energy over that of the diesel generator in terms of the net present cost and the cost of energy. It also concluded that diesel pumps are typically characterized by a lower capital cost but a very high operation and maintenance cost. Solar is the opposite, with a considerably higher capital cost but very low ongoing operation and maintenance costs.},

Nearly half of the rural population relies on agriculture for a living, and the recent energy crisis has had a negative impact on rural communities. Farmers’ reliance on fossil fuels for the operation of irrigation systems has increased exponentially, resulting in the high costs of agricultural production. Primary data regarding on-farm agriculture and irrigation practices used in this study were collected through an intensive on-farm survey, while secondary data were taken from published reports and statistics. The results of the current investigation show that the installation of PV systems has resulted in the increased adoption of high-efficiency irrigation systems, a reduction in the high operational costs incurred on account of old diesel-powered pumping systems (with an annual saving of 6.6 million liters of diesel), a 100\% increase in farmer’s income, a reduction of 17,622 tons of CO2 emissions per annum, and 41\% savings in water. The unit cost of PV-powered HEIS was found to be 0.1219 USD/kWh, which was 4\% and 66\% less than subsidized electricity cost and diesel cost, respectively.},

	abstract = {In order to meet global energy demands with clean renewable energy such as with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, large surface areas are needed because of the relatively diffuse nature of solar energy. Much of this demand can be matched with aggressive building integrated PV and rooftop PV, but the remainder can be met with land-based PV farms. Using large tracts of land for solar farms will increase competition for land resources as food production demand and energy demand are both growing and vie for the limited land resources. This land competition is exacerbated by the increasing population. These coupled land challenges can be ameliorated using the concept of agrivoltaics or co-developing the same area of land for both solar PV power as well as for conventional agriculture. In this paper, the agrivoltaic experiments to date are reviewed and summarized. A coupled simulation model is developed for both PV production (PVSyst) and agricultural production (Simulateur mulTIdisciplinaire les Cultures Standard (STICS) crop model), to gauge the technical potential of scaling agrivoltaic systems. The results showed that the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30\% increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture. Utilizing shade tolerant crops enables crop yield losses to be minimized and thus maintain crop price stability. In addition, this dual use of agricultural land can have a significant effect on national PV production. The results showed an increase in PV power between over 40 and 70GW if lettuce cultivation alone is converted to agrivoltaic systems in the U.S. It is clear, further work is warranted in this area and that the outputs for different crops and geographic areas should be explored to ascertain the potential of agrivoltaic farming throughout the globe.},

Desertification is quickly becoming an environmental issue of increasing concern because of its complex relationship with and the implications of climate change. The Sahel, which runs through Mali, is especially prone to desertification as it is a fragile ecosystem easily affected by climatic changes and human activities. Mali is experiencing major problems, particularly because of a high population growth rate, intensive cultivation (agriculture and farming) methods and an increasing demand for resources, such as firewood, land and water. Mitigation to address these issues will have to be implemented both at the national level and enforced at the local level, forming and utilizing relationships between government departments, non-governmental organizations and other groups such as local community organizations. Current mitigation efforts include agroforestry, Jatropha cultivation and many other activities. Whatever action is taken, it must take cultural traditions as well as modern practices into consideration to ensure environmental stability and sustainable development.},

A minimum of 50\% reduction of biomass consumption in the residential sector and a maximum of 71\% was achieved through the combination of grid extension and decentralized solar PV. Solar PV becomes the preferable option when enough time for the effects of electricity on income is given. When these effects are not present, solar PV is still a better option, as the amount of biomass replaced with electricity is reduced.},
