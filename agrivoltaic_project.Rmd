# **Introduction**
Today's agriculture is characterized by innovation. New technologies, new and optimized 
machines, and more sustainable and efficient systems are constantly coming onto the market to 
maximize profits, minimize expenses, and have as little negative or even positive impact on the environment as possible.

One of these agricultural innovations are agrivoltaic systems, which combine the 
advantages and benefits of photovoltaic panels with the demands and realities of agricultural 
farming. The photovoltaic elements can be mounted on the arable land either in the ground, 
leaving enough space between the elements for the cultivation of the land, or on 
stilts with the area underneath the stilts used for agriculture. In this way, the panels provide shade, reduce water losses due to evaporation and generate energy that can be further used on the farm [@dinesh_potential_2016].

Agrivoltaic systems thus have a high potential to reduce energy costs while not reducing yield (for shade-tolerant crops) and may even be yield enhancing as long as there is no significant loss of area (as would be the case with panels on stilts).

In developing countries, agricultural production and processing often fall short of their 
potential. Innovations are needed to better exploit the potential of the agri-food sector for the sustainable development of rural areas. They could promote employment, strengthen food 
security, and counteract the effects of climate change and inappropriate land use. Innovations such as agrivoltaic systems could hence also drive progress in agriculture and the economy in 
developing countries.

## Current Situation in Mali

Mali is one of the world's poorest countries. According to the German Federal Ministry for 
Economic Cooperation and Development [@noauthor_sehr_nodate], development cooperation with Mali is locally 
based and focuses on projects that directly improve the living conditions of the population.The focus of this commitment in Mali is above all on securing food and agriculture, supplying drinking water, and establishing viable decentralized government structures [@noauthor_mali_nodate-1]. Agriculture plays a particularly important role, as it contributes a total of 36% to the gross domestic product (GDP) and thus the majority of the population derives its livelihood from agriculture [@noauthor_agriculture_nodate].

Especially in the north of Mali, the climate is dry and hot, and the rainy season lasts less than a month. Although it is wetter in the south of the country and there is more rainfall, Mali is one of the countries most affected by climate change worldwide. Rainfall there has halved in a generation and dry periods between rains are becoming much longer. The soil is increasingly unable to absorb the water and desertification is steadily increasing [@holthuijzen_dry_2011]. This has an aggravating effect on agriculture and also enormously limits the choice of crops that can be cultivated, since only very drought-resistant crops can be grown. However, not only the climate, but also the lack of access to electricity, especially in rural areas, hampers the production of agricultural goods and restricts socioeconomic development, as only about 31% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, with the figure in rural Mali at just 19% in 2016 [@sessa_rural_2021].

## Why Agrivoltaic? {#agri}
As the lack of field irrigation in Mali's rural areas is the most significant limiting factor in crop production, agrivoltaic systems could be a potential alternative, as they could provide electricity to run pumps to harvest groundwater. With the electricity generated by the system, local smallholder farmers would be independent of grid electricity availability and could grow a greater variety of crops due to increased water availability.
In addition, the shading effect of the agrivoltaic panels then would mitigate water demand due to reduced evaporation, which would also lower the need for water in pumped irrigation.

The electricity available through the agrivoltaic system could also benefit people living in the immediate area, as excess energy not needed for farming could be used to supply electricity to the surrounding area. In addition, water generated by the pumps could be used communally (should there be enough) to provide electricity and water to surrounding farms or even private households.

## Potential Problems 
As many benefits agrivoltaic must bring, they also carry certain risks. Not only are the initial costs quite high, but the maintenance and servicing of the panels also requires a certain level of expertise. In Mali, the illiteracy rate is around 65%, and 47% of Malians are under the age of 15. Just half of the children finish elementary school [@noauthor_sehr_nodate]. It is therefore questionable whether the smallholder farmers are capable of professionally maintaining the panels to get the maximum benefit from the system. Moreover, this could increase the maintenance costs of photovoltaic panels, which, if it were to become rampant, would reduce the profitability of such a system.

Another problem could be the falling groundwater level due to the increasing drought. The 
lower it falls, the deeper the wells would have to be for the pump to extract water. The 
consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly noticeable and cannot be accurately 
predicted, so they represent a correspondingly high risk in any planning affecting agriculture

## Decision
As Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world and receives special support from various aid organizations, such as NGOs or also various governmental organizations, we are particularly interested in the profitability of such an investment on the part of an NGO or a 
governmental aid institution. Here we do not only consider the profit or loss margin of the farmer, but also and especially the benefits for the local community. Is such an investment advisable after deducting the acquisition costs, considering the socio-economic benefits?

### Option 1
The decision maker decides to invest in agrivoltaic systems on a smallholder farm. The initial costs are covered by the organization, while the farmer has to take care of the maintenance and installation costs. The surplus electricity, as well as the water that is generated but not consumed, benefits the local community. The benefits of having an existing electrical supply outweigh the cost of purchase.


### Option 2
After considering the cost-benefit ratio, the decision maker decides that investing in an 
agrivoltaic system on a smallholder farm is not worthwhile because of the high initial cost. The benefit from the surplus energy is not large enough or the surplus energy is not sufficient to supply the local community adequately.



# **Methods**

After  extensive  literature  research  on  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  agrivoltaics, 
particularly  in  developing  countries  and  West  Africa,  we  chose  to  develop  our  model  with  a 
millet-growing smallholder farmer who installs photovoltaic panels on a small area of his farm 
after receiving a financial subsidy from an NGO and/or a government organization. 
To illustrate possible options and correlations, we developed a conceptual model that was used 
as a guide for our model code, showing the monetary and socioeconomic impacts of investing 
in an agrivoltaic system on both the revenue and the community (Fig. \@ref(fig:conmodel)). To create the 
model and for the probabilistic analyses, we used the *decisionSupport* package [@R-decisionSupport] and the *DiagrammeR* package [@R-DiagrammeR] in R. 

## Decision Maker

The  decision  maker  in  our  model  is  a  development  aid  organization,  for  example,  a  non-
governmental organization (NGO) or a governmental institution, which thus has an interest in 
improving  living  conditions  in  rural  regions  of  developing  countries  and  providing  a  better 
supply  of  electricity,  water  and  food.  The  aim  is  to  promote  self-sufficiency  and  self-
responsibility in the community and to make it sustainably less dependent on development aid. 
The organization has sufficient financial resources at its disposal to support small farmers in 
Mali's rural regions in acquiring and commissioning agrivoltaic systems.

## Conceptual Model 

The conceptual model is used to illustrate various influences on the cost-benefit analysis for an 
investment in agrivoltaics. 

The result is a comparison of the costs and benefits of commissioning the system. The benefits are composed of socio-economic benefits, yield and labor savings. In contrast to the standard farm, the yield after an installation of agrivoltaics is affected by additional irrigation and by the 
possibility  of  growing  less  heat-tolerant  shade  crops.  This  would  allow  the  farmer  more flexibility to grow crops with a higher market price than millet in the shade of the panels, which could lead to increased revenue in addition to increased yields due to the ability to irrigate. In 
addition,  the  energy  that  would  be  generated  by  the  panels  and  be  used  for  irrigation  would affect the risk of droughts, as yields, and thus food security, would no longer be as threatened by drought. 

Although the farmer's income also plays a role in the decision, as the farmer must be financially able to make any repairs to the facility that may be necessary, and in addition, a greater yield results in improved food security and economy, the primary focus of a development assistance organization  is  on  the  benefits  to  the  village  community.  People  in  the  rural  regions  of  Mali would experience a significant improvement in living conditions through access to electricity. In addition, a well with an electrically operated pump would contribute to the water supply and, as already mentioned, such a facility could contribute to the stability of food security. However, all of this is conditioned by the risk of poor-quality panels, as they would potentially generate less energy, making irrigation more difficult. The risk for poor maintenance and the risk for incorrect installation could also have a negative impact on profit. Thus, on the one hand, the cost of installation and instantholding could increase for both the farmer and the organization, and on the other hand, the income from the agrivoltaic systems could be reduced. 
Training farmers on maintenance and servicing could reduce the risk of incorrect maintenance, but this would initially entail additional costs.

## Stakeholders

A Stakeholder is "any group or individual who is affected by or can affect the achievement of an organization's objectives" [@freeman_stakeholder_2001]. Stakeholder management is needed to balance the interests of all stakeholders with regard to their positions. Different stakeholders can have varying influence, depending on their position, to the result of the project outcome. For this project, communication did not take place with all stakeholders, and there was also not enough data to plot all stakeholders in a graph depending on their willingness to cooperate, their interest in the final goal or their influence on the decision maker for example.

The project has local stakeholders as well as those from abroad in the form of development aid organizations (Fig. \@ref(fig:stakeholders)). To some extent, also the abroad government, as well as the population of the country and other groups that influence the decisions of the development aid organizations can be counted as stakeholders. At the local level there is the government, which becomes a stakeholder through political guidelines, but also through monetary grants. Many African countries are also striving for development goals, like the "Uganda Vision 2040" idea [@noauthor_uganda_nodate]. The Malian government also has those goals, which include the generation of electricity via solar energy [@noauthor_malian_2017]. Future-oriented projects, like agrivoltaic systems, are therefore interesting for the government.

The projects are executed at farms, and therefore farmers play an important role in the question if those projects will succeed. A close communication between experts and farmers is essential to reduce risks, which could lead otherwise into difficulties. The addition of agrivoltaics aims to benefit not only the smallholder farmers directly, but also the surrounding community. An agrivoltaic system shared by smallholder farmers can lead to a close water access to new parts of rural areas. Other benefits for the community that can come with an agrivoltaic intervention are independent electricity, which can be used from charging mobile devices to cooling dairy products [@owusu-kwarteng_microbial_2020] or medication inside a refrigerator [@opiyo_how_2020]. Photovoltaic supply companies play an important role while setting up an agrivoltaic systems. They need to contribute suitable solar panels devices, which can be installed and be maintained with the knowledge of locally available electricians. Those maintenance workers play a key role in the lifespan of those projects. And it is possible that with an increase in the use of solar panels, the number of learned electricians will also increase. An agrivoltaic intervention brings new growing conditions in the shade of the panels and irrigation possibilities with ground water pumps, which can be used to produce crops that would have been previously unable to grow. These new products can influence the local market place, transport processes or even nutrition deficits. More distant stakeholder are nearby communities, anyone who is groundwater dependent or power plant companies, although for stakeholder management these probably do not have to be considered.

## Input Estimates
The estimates are given in ranges with 90% certainty and normally distributed. To produce reliable estimates, calibration is needed. Becoming a calibrated estimator, can be achieved with calibration tests, that help to improve the ability to correctly estimate ranges. The goal is to examine the own tendencies of misjudging and to use the new found knowledge for self-improvement. Constant values in the case of the experiment duration for example are also valid inputs. In combination with the model function, the input estimates are then used to calculate the Monte-Carlo simulation. The estimates were collected with two different methods.

The base of our estimates originates from literature research, which was conducted on experiments and publications with adaptable scenarios to the project. Care was taken to ensure that comparable conditions existed or that the values were interpolated and adapted to our case. For the literature, publications about agrivoltaics mostly in western Africa were of highest interest, but also other literature about photovoltaic and developing aid were considered. Input ranges with the topic of agriculture were estimated with the help of publications like @noauthor_new_nodate; @noauthor_mali_nodate; @noauthor_post_nodate.
For the variables regarding the topic of photovoltaic including costs, efficiency and production publications from @noauthor_agri-photovoltaik_nodate; @raza_socio-economic_2022; @shouman_economics_2016 were used. To estimate the ranges about the life and households in western Africa information was gathered in @rapsomanikis_economic_nodate.

options(scipen = 999)
input_estimates <- read.csv("data/av_estimates_overview_updated_description.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
input_estimates = subset(input_estimates, select = -c(median))
kable(input_estimates[2:7])
```


## Questionnaire
After we determined estimates for the input variables based on the literature research, we then decided to create a questionnaire to get more precise values. The idea was to send it to several experts who work on similar projects, have experience with photovoltaic systems or agriculture in Africa, as well as farmers in West Africa who could give us valuable information about current market prices and general agricultural conditions. 

The questionnaire included agricultural related questions (e.g. “Estimate the impact of a severe drought on the yield of millet in [%] on a standard farm.”), technical questions about the photovoltaic system (e.g.''Estimate the potential annual costs for general maintenance of an agrivoltaic system (e.g. repairs, cleaning, preventive maintenance etc.)”) as well as questions related to irrigation (e.g. ”Estimate the potential yield increase in [%] with an irrigation system.”). It was structured so that the participants had to estimate a range for each variable and were able to skip the questions they were not certain about. We contacted a number of experts, but unfortunately not many participants completed the questionnaire.

## Code 
The code generates two Monte Carlo simulation outcomes and is affected by multiple variables from the 'av_estimates' table. One outcome represents a farm with AV intervention and one outcome a reference farm. Further the AV intervention is split into planning, setup and execution parts.
The outcomes are based on a time series analysis for 30 years and 6000 simulations.

### Variability

Some variables vary over the 30 years of simulation. This variation was created with the 'vv' function and the variable 'vv_var' which represents a coefficient of variation. 'vv_var' has a lower and upper bound of 5% and 20%.


### Chance events

Risks were included as chance events with the 'chance_event' function.
Two of those risks were missing input of the population or institutions which would lead to a failure of the project. This would result in planning costs and no benefits through the AV system.

Further risks are 'bad quality of photo voltaic panels' resulting in a lower energy yield than expected, 'bad installation' of the panels and 'bad maintenance' both resulting in higher maintenance costs and 'droughts'. The first three risks reduce the benefits of the AV intervention while 'drought' only has a reducing effect on farms without AV intervention through missing irrigation opportunities.

# **Results and Discussion**

## Net Present Value (NPV) distributions

The graph and the boxplot shows the NPV difference of the reference farm to the AV farm (Fig. @\ref(fig:NPV)). The x-axis represents the outcome distribution, the y-axis the density estimate (affected by the number of simulations in a specific outcome range).

The distribution has two peaks. One at around -5000€ and one at around +5000€ but with a lower density estimate. Both the median and the lower quartile is in a negative range shown by the boxplot.


```{r NPV, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference in NPV between Intervention and no Intervention"}
plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = example_mc_simulation, 
                   vars = "NPV_decision",
                   method = 'boxplot_density')
```

As there is no external investment included in the model at this point the distribution shows probabilities of monetary costs and benefits of an AV intervention. If e.g. a fixed investment of 10000€ is assumed for each simulation the curve would be mostly in a positive outcome distribution. This investment would be the the cost for an institution to achieve all the non-monetary benefits (Section \@ref(agri)) while it would have no negative monetary impacts in most cases anymore for the operators of the AV facility. As the AV facility would be operated for around 30 years an investment of 10000€ would mean costs of around 330€ for supporting infrastructure, communities and food production mentioned in the sustainable development goals (SDG)[@noauthor_agenda_nodate]. Further it could enable other opportunities as a higher income for farmers could lead to economic growth.

## EVPI, VIP, Cashflow

The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is an estimation of the monetary value for any additional information that reduces uncertainty for specific variables in the model. It was calculated to identify the variables for which further information could be beneficial in order to increase certainty of the decision.

In our results the EVPI values were either at zero or very low for all the variables (> 200 USD, Fig. \@ref(fig:EVPI)). However, since the result of the NPV is also low, even very low values of the EVPI should be considered as they can have an impact on the outcome.
The highest EVPI was calculated for the yield of millet and the irrigation factor. Irrigation of millet influences the final yield and therefore both variables are crucial for the revenues of the farmer. Gathering additional information about these factors could help to increase certainty about the millet yield, thus the NPV. It is recommended to further investigate the variables with an EVPI above 150 USD to make a better decision.

With the PLS analysis the variable importance in projection (VIP) can be calculated. The VIP scores represent the sensitivity of the model on each variable.

In Fig. \@ref(fig:VIP) the important variables (VIP > 1) are shown. Variables can either be negatively correlated with the decision outcome (red bars) or there is a positive correlation between the variable and the outcome (blue bars). Our results indicate that the yield of millet and the irrigation factor (Increased yield [%], fig.\@ref(fig:VIP)) are the most important variables for the projection, with an VIP above 3. High yields and an improved yield through irrigation increase the NPV accordingly. The decision output is equally sensitive to all the costs of the intervention, particularly the annual costs of repairs (VIP > 2) have a negative effect on the NPV. The amount of the annual costs are also dependent on the level of maintenance. Poor maintenance increases the costs and thus negatively affects the decision outcome.

Figure \@ref(fig:Cash) shows the annual cashflow over the whole period of the simulation. In our model the cashflow is rather low, likely due to the low estimations for revenues of the additional crop, which is grown under the photovoltaic modules. Overall the returns are steady but just above the zero mark for each year, and only a small chance (5% quantile) for a negative cashflow.

## Uncertainties and Issues

In our project we identified several uncertainties that could be included in the model. Due to time constraints not all uncertainties were implemented. We also faced other issues which are listed in the following section. 

The first problem we had was the almost non-existent participation in our questionnaire. We decided not to use the answers for our model because they were inconclusive. We assume that the large number of questions resulted in a low participation. For that reason, some ranges of the input variables are merely based on our own estimations.

In our project the photovoltaic system is mainly used to power a water pump for irrigation. But over the rainy season, which occurs around June until September [@noauthor_climate_nodate], when little or no irrigation is required, there will be a surplus of electricity. During this time, the system brings no advantage to the farmer. For such a scenario, the electricity needs a different recipient. This could be a cooling system for post-harvest crops storage, supply of other households and farmers or even electricity sales, if it is connected to the main power grid. But this creates new challenges. Rural areas are usually not connected to the power grid and any additional investment bears new uncertainties.

Furthermore we implemented the risk of bad maintenance. In the case of bad maintained modules, the farmer will have additional annual costs. However, in our model it does not affect the lifetime nor the PV yield of the modules. But since there is a risk that bad maintenance facilitates the degradation [@dolara_investigation_2014; @appels_effect_2013; @sisodia_impact_2019], thus the lifetime and the annual energy yield (also the EVPI and VIP were high, meaning this variable is important to the decision), adding it to the model should be considered. In addition, there are other uncertainties that should be taken into account as they may affect the decision outcome. Uncertainties such as political instability within the country, outbreak of war and changing conditions due to climate change, which can have a greater impact on the standard of living in less developed countries and the agricultural value chain. But implementing these factors in our model is challenging, because it is unclear how they correlate with the input variables and due to a lack of accurate estimates of their impact on the other factors. 

# **Conclusion**
In this project we applied the decision analysis method to evaluate the decision of installing agrivoltaic systems on smallholder farms in Mali. Agrivoltaic systems have the potential to improve the living conditions in Mali and other countries located in western Africa. Communities are provided with electricity, which can be used for various applications, but should mainly supplied to pumps for the extraction of groundwater. The groundwater allows irrigation approaches, which enable the cultivation of new crops to the farms. Also whole communities can benefit from the new generated resources, by reducing the time and the human power for water gathering, Those innovations lead to an empowerment in rural areas, which could help to decrease the gap between urban and rural life. The analysis shows that the difference of no intervention compared to the case of the intervention has a NPV balanced around zero after 30 years, although a positive NPV is slightly more likely, which can also be seen on the cashflow chart. But existing uncertainties in crop yield and the effects of irrigation on yield should be further investigated to increase certainty of the forecasted decision outcome. Nevertheless, with the support of organizations, agrivoltaic systems are a promising approach to improve livelihoods in rural areas.
